## General Information
- Project is based on helping a US based bike sharing provider BoomBikes that have multiple bike sharing systems allowing people to borrow a bike from a dock and bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system that faced loss in corona pandemic.
- The company want to understand which factors are significant in predicting demand of shared bikes and how well does those variables define the demand.
- We used a multiple linear regression model to predict the demand of shared bikes and interpretation of factors that influence them.
- We are using an excel file that contains time series data of 2018 and 2019 containing weather condition, temperature and other ambient factors, detailed related to workday, holiday, week and season on daily basis.

## Conclusions
- boomBikes growth has increased by a great margin in 2019 compared to 2018, depicts company growth year after another.
- factors that increase the count of bookings : Year, Temperature, Summer, Winter and month of sepetember.
- Factors that decrease the count of bookings : Light Snow or light Rain, Mist+Cloudy, Month of July and January, Holiday, High windspeed and humidity.
- Top 5 Factors that affect customer count(in descending order) : Temperature, Light Snow or light Rain, year, Windspeed and humidity.
